## Introduction

This is a project that was bulit in response to a codecademy project specification.

The specificaiton was as follows:

"For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. Youâ€™re welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to your liking.

Project Objectives:
Build a message generator program using JavaScript
Use Git version control
Use command line
Develop locally on your computer"

The basis of this project was to bring together what I have learned about JavaScript as well as what I have learned about using git version control, command line, github and markdown.

## Technologies

- Javascript ES6

## Setup

This project should run on almost all basic computers and does not require any special libraries or programs to run. Simply launce the project from the commandline using any package which can run Node.
